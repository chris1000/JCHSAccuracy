<h2>Johns Creek High School FBLA submission for Website Design 2018 - 2019</h2>JCHS Accuracy was designed with the latest in HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. This allowed us to add advanced Progressive Web App (https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) functionality to the website. JCHS Accuracy is hosted with Googles Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) platform and takes advantage of their advanced caching features to provide offline browsing functionality (to an extent). JCHS Accuracy also leverages Google CDN (https://cloud.google.com/cdn/) to provide fast low-latency content delivery. 

<h2>Build</h2> To build/test code clone this project and install the Polymer CLI (https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli). CD into the directory and run "polymer build" or if on Linux Based systems you can run the "produce.sh" script to run the process automatically. To spawn a local web server for testing the code run "polymer serve --open" this will open the webpage in your default browser.
