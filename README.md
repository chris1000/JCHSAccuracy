<h2>Johns Creek High School Website Design 2018 - 2019</h2>JCHS Accuracy was designed with the latest in HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. This allowed us to add advanced Progressive Web App (https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) functionality to the website. JCHS Accuracy is hosted with Googles Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) platform and takes advantage of their advanced caching features to provide offline browsing functionality (to an extent). JCHS Accuracy also leverages Google CDN (https://cloud.google.com/cdn/) to provide fast low-latency content delivery. 

<h2>Build</h2> To test code clone this project and install the Polymer CLI (https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli). CD into the directory and run "polymer build" or if on Linux Based systems you can run the "produce.sh" script to run the process automatically. To spawn a local web server for testing the code run "polymer serve --open" this will open the webpage in your default browser.

<h2>Note</h2> JCHS Accuracy makes use of Javascript and Browser Cookies to enhance/ provide the functionality of certian features such as our Accessibilities Tool Menu (Font Scaling Tool, Translations, Color Switcher) and Cookie Concent Form (To make sure it is only displayed once). To improve overall website loading times we have minified (https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/minification/) our code using the Google Polymer CLI toolkit (https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) but have kept the code hosted here unminified (to view minified code enter into the "~/build/production" directory of this repository. To view our polymer configuration view the "polymer.json" file in the main directory.
